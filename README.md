# positive-or-negative-comments
Goes through a reddit thread and tries to decide if the general tone of the comments is positive or negative.

This script will ask for a good word (for example Jennifer Lawrence) and a bad word (for example Comcast) and then build a word count database based upon submissions after a search of each word. The user then provides a URL to a submission and the script will try to decide if the comments are positive or negative by comparing them to the word database.
